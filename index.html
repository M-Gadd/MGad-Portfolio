      <h1>Hi, I am Mostafa and I build Websites</h1>
      <p>  After having finished the web development bootcamp at Ironhack Paris, 
        I am proficient in Javascript, Angular2, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, ES6, 
        TypeScript, HTML & CSS. Currently, I am a teacher assistant at Ironhack paris bootcamp
        and I am looking for a position where I can combine my web development skills 
        with my business background.</p> 
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p>In July 2013, I completed my bachelors degree at the German university in Cairo where 
      I obtained a double major in Economics and Finance. Last year, 
      I finished my Masters degree in Financial Management at the University of Buckingham. 
      During the past 5 years I worked between finance, business analysis and business strategy 
      in both Egypt and Hungary. Whether through the modules that I chose at both the Bachelor 
      and Master level or through my professional experience, I was always intrigued in research
       and analysis.</p> 

      <p>I have always been fascinated by the tech and the tech industry, 
      but my passion for technology grew bigger when I worked on a couple of 
      projects in start-up companies and I was introduced to the world of software
       development where I found those people who are sitting behind their laptops and 
       they bring new ideas to the world everyday.</p>

       <p>My experiences in the past five years have also allowed me to develop my personal
          skills. I have lived, studied, volunteered and worked in many countries, 
          which eventually widened my mind-set. My experiences abroad taught me how to 
          think globally, interact with others from different backgrounds and develop 
          my confidence needed to succeed in a competitive environment. In addition to 
          my growing passion for coding which is pushing me to enhance my skills everyday.</p>

          <p>I am looking for a Full Stack Web Development position both in France and abroad. 
            Throughout the bootcamp I learned that I like both the front and back end technologies
             and I would like to enhance and improve my skills on both ends. 
             I also like to work on an open and helpful environment as I believe this 
             will be the key to enhance and improve my skills. </p>
